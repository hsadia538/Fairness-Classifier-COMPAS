Project Overview

This project aims to reduce recidivism rates by training and evaluating various machine learning classifiers on the COMPAS dataset. The dataset contains information on criminal offenders and is used to assess the likelihood of recidivism. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to build models that can provide more accurate and fair predictions, ultimately contributing to more just criminal justice decisions.

Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to develop a predictive model for recidivism risk. Our specific goals include:

	•	Preprocessing the COMPAS dataset to remove bias and ensure fairness.
	•	Training multiple classifiers to predict recidivism, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
	•	Evaluating the performance of each model and comparing the results based on accuracy, precision, recall, and fairness metrics.

Dataset

We used the COMPAS dataset, which includes features such as:

	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	Race
	•	Number of prior offenses
	•	Charge degree
	•	Recidivism outcome (target variable)


We evaluated the models based on various performance metrics:

	•	Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
	•	Precision & Recall: Used to evaluate the predictive power for positive recidivism cases.
	•	Fairness: Assessed bias based on sensitive attributes like race and gender, ensuring our model predictions were as unbiased as possible.

Conclusion

Our group project highlights the potential and challenges of using machine learning to predict recidivism risk. While some models showed promising results in terms of accuracy, ensuring fairness remains a critical challenge that needs further exploration.
